## 🔴 It's very heard to solder Aluminium sheet `--> so I create a liquid combination`

> combination of harpic liquid with dust of battery cell, can create a transparent liquid.

> The trick is works very well `But not works on Aluminum`, so I drill a hole 🕳️ for connection.

# 🔴 Day 4 `Test`

> The SMPS power supply is Switch-OFF. When i connect it's light up 🚨 but when the touch the opposite side it's also light up 🚨 but give a current sock ⚡

> When i start the process (SMPS Switch ON - 5min) the `capacitor heat-up` very quickly after some time 🔥

> Any the voltage between `Rod` & `Aluminum sheet` is 30 ⁉️🤔, But it should have been 60. 🔴

# Fluid problem

### 🟢 After unsuccessful work (no a single scratch on Al) & after the capacitor over heat 🔥 check the IGBT

> IGBT can decress the voltage so the LED looks very dim But it's work very good. 🟢

## 🟢 Electrical Resistance Test

> So the fluid is not completely `ion free`. So thats why (may be) when i start the process the capacitor heat-up 🔥
