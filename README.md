### **Step 1: Working Principle of EDM**
- EDM works by generating **electrical sparks** to erode metal surfaces.
- It requires a **power supply**, an **electrode**, a **workpiece**, and a **dielectric fluid**.
- The **electrode (cathode)** and **workpiece (anode)** are submerged in **dielectric fluid**, and a **high-frequency electrical discharge** removes metal from the workpiece.

---

## Questions / Answers 

### 1) 10 ms pulse duration is okey?

- The 10 ms pulse duration (957 Hz frequency) means each pulse occurs in about 1.04 milliseconds, which is extremely fast.
- This is normal for EDM because metal cutting occurs due to rapid, repetitive electrical discharges.
- Since these pulses are too fast for the human eye, a storage oscilloscope or high-speed data logger is required to analyze them.

---

### 2) Is This Setup Okay for EDM?

‚úÖ `For testing the circuit: Yes`, using an LED is a great way to check if the circuit is generating pulses correctly.

‚ùå `For actual metal cutting: No`, because EDM requires high voltage (~50-300V) and high current pulses, whereas your 555 timer circuit only operates at 10V with limited current.

---

## üåÄ Disadvantages of the circuit & Modifications for EDM:

### 1. Increase the Voltage and Current

- Your current 10V setup is too low for metal cutting.
- EDM typically requires a capacitor discharge circuit (CDM) with higher voltage (50V-300V) and high peak currents.

### 2. Use a MOSFET or IGBT for High Power Switching

- The 555 timer can only drive small loads.
- For EDM, use a MOSFET (IRF540, IRFZ44N) or IGBT (like GT50J325) to handle the high voltage and current needed for discharge.

### 3. Pulse Duration and Duty Cycle Tuning

- Modify the resistors (10kŒ©, 1kŒ©) and capacitor (100¬µF) to adjust the pulse width and frequency for better discharge performance.

   - The **resistor** controls the charging speed.  

2. **Discharge Phase (Cutting Metal):**  
   - The **MOSFET/IGBT switches ON** for a short duration (microseconds to milliseconds).  
   - High voltage **discharges across the electrode and metal workpiece**, creating sparks.  
   - **Metal erodes due to high-energy sparks.**  
   - **Dielectric fluid removes debris and cools the workpiece.**

### **Things to Consider**
üç• **Use a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Circuit**  
   - A **555 Timer** or **Arduino** can generate pulses for better control.  

üç• **Heat Management**  
   - **Use a heatsink for the MOSFET/IGBT.**  
   - **Submerge the workpiece and electrode in EDM oil or water** to cool the cutting area.  

üç• **Workpiece and Electrode Setup**  
   - The **electrode (copper, graphite, or tungsten)** should be **small and precise** for a 1mm sheet.  
   - **Electrode gap (0.1mm - 0.5mm) is critical for stable cutting.**

## Why I not using 555 IC ?
#### both the 555 timer IC and Arduino Uno (or any microcontroller) can generate PWM signals and control timing. However, the reason 555 IC is not recommended in many cases, especially for applications requiring precise PWM control

1. Precision & Stability

- 555 Timer: Frequency and duty cycle depend on passive components (resistors, capacitors, potentiometers), which can drift over time due to temperature changes, component tolerances, and aging.
- Arduino: Generates highly accurate PWM with software control, and timing is managed digitally by the internal crystal oscillator, making it much more stable.

---

2. Frequency Adjustability

- 555 Timer: You can change frequency with a potentiometer, but the adjustment is not smooth or linear. Also, if you need real-time changes, you would need additional circuits like digital potentiometers.
- Arduino: You can adjust frequency and duty cycle dynamically using code (e.g., analogWrite() or PWM libraries).

---

3. Duty Cycle Control

- 555 Timer: Adjusting both frequency and duty cycle independently is complicated and requires extra components.
- Arduino: Full control over duty cycle and frequency independently, which is crucial for motor control, signal generation, etc.

---

4. Multiple Outputs & Complexity

- 555 Timer: If you need multiple PWM outputs, you need multiple 555 ICs, making the circuit bulky.
- Arduino: Can generate multiple PWM signals (on different pins) simultaneously and synchronize them easily.

---

5. Software Control & Customization

- 555 Timer: Once designed, changing the behavior requires modifying hardware (resistors, capacitors).
- Arduino: Just update the software; no need to change hardware.

## üåï EDM using ‚úÖ **Arduino UNO**
#### I using arduino you know to control the PWM signal using potentiometer, using 555 IC we can easily change the frequency what you have to control the time.
