We can add a red light 🚨, because to observe the cathode & anode is directly touched or not, and also want to know we use the real dielectric fluid or not ???

because if you use fake 😉 dielectric fluid so the electric passes easily and it causes `NPN TRANSFER`  little current flows between `Base` & `Collector` --> in this condition the red light 🌟 glows up 🍒.

#### and when maintain the Gap, and use a real EDM dielectric fluid (like EDM 250) then we can switch the current to the main circuit AUTOMATICALLY and the LED glows 🌟 down 🚨. and IT'S indicate nothing is in short circuit mode ✅ (the brass road and the aluminium sheet is not directly connected & use a real dielectric fluid which is not a allowed to flow the current).

# 🚩 why i cancel to using Relay ?

in our system I using transistors and transistors can make a `noise environment`. because of Relay became very unstable and switch anytime in the middle of cutting ✂️. 
🔴 because of this unstable `switching` it can convert the main voltage to the red light 🚨 and make a `uneven cutting` ✂️ on aluminium sheet. 

### So I cancel ❌ to use `Automatic` mode. and make it `Manual` 💪🏽. 🟢 and make two electrical circuits completely different from each other. or I can use a manual switch.
