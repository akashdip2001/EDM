We can add a red light 🚨, because have to observe the cathode and anode is directly touched or not, and also want to know we use the real dielectric fluid or not. 

because if you use fake 😉 dielectric field so the electric passes easily and make the circuit complete and in `NPN TRANSFER`  little current flows between `Base` & `Collector` --> this condition the red light 🌟 glows up 🍒.

#### and when maintain the gas, and use a real idiom dielectric fluid (like EDM 250) then we can switch the current to the main circuit and the LED glows 🌟 down. and indicate nothing is in short circuit mode (the brass road and the aluminium sheet is not directly connected & and use a real dielectric fluid which is not a allowed to flow the current).

# 🚩 why we not using relay ?

in our system we using transistors and transistors can make a noise environment. because of this relay became very unstable and switch anytime. 

because of this `switching` it can convert the main voltage to the red light 🚨 and make a UN event cutting ✂️ on aluminium sheet. 

### So I cancel ❌ to use `Automatic` mode. and make it `Manual` 💪🏽
