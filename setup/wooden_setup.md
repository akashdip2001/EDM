# ðŸŸ¢ Why Brass Rod ?

### ðŸ”µ In EDM machines, traditionally `Copper rods` are used because:

- High electrical conductivity (almost the best after silver),
- Good wear resistance in EDM sparking,
- Stable spark generation.

### BUT copper has some disadvantages, especially in small DIY projects:

---

## ðŸŸ¢ To use Brass Rod:

### When brass erodes during EDM sparking, it creates smoother debris particles compared to copper â€” this helps prevent shorts in small DIY setups without a strong flushing system.

1. Brass is cheaper than pure copper.
2. Brass is harder than copper.
      Brass rod is more mechanically strong, it will not bend easily during EDM cutting.
3. Sparking stability for aluminum cutting is OK with brass.
      for cutting soft aluminum (1mm sheet), which does not need very high conductivity.
4. Brass rods are easier to find in local markets.
